# COBOL Class
___________
At State Tech, all Computer Application Students are required to take and pass a COBOL class
I have added all assignments to this repository and will give a breif description of what it required

## Overview
___________
In this class, we learned the basics of COBOL, which was very interesting, as it was completely different
than any other language that State Tech had gone over. Unfortunately, we had a very poor teacher for this
course which led to a lot of complications and stress, but eventually we overcame that and had a very 
successful end of semester sprint.

## Assignments
__________
A large majority of our assignments were made with the objective of keeping track of fake insurance records
given to us by our instructor. About half-way through the year I switched from just compiling my work in
terminal to using OpenCOBOLIDE, as there were some issues that we were not able to figure out until runnning
the code through the IDE.

### Basic Math
_______
As the file name suggests, this assignment was to teach us how to perform mathematical equations in COBOL

### readTXT
___________
This was another simple assignment where the objective was to read from a text file and format an output

### iceCream-shop
_________
For this assignment, we were tasked with creating a menu for an ice cream shop that allowed customers to pick
their size and flavor of ice cream, and allowed the user to loop as many times as they wanted to before getting the total

### readDAT
________
This assignment was very similar to the readTXT assignment, but we were reading from a .dat file instead, which introduced its own challenges

### read-editDAT
________
Read-editDAT built off of the readDAT assignment by adding the ability to edit and save the file that was opened

### recByAgentOG
________
RecByAgentOG was a trickier assignment, where we had to pull the data from a .dat file and pull all records associated with a specic agent and print out each agent's records one by one. Ideally, we would have added page breaks, but since we were just working within OpenCOBOLIDE/compiling in terminal, there was not a great way to practice that.

### editAgent
________
In editAgent, we had to implement the ability to change/add an agent record to the .dat file.

### cobol-call
_________
In cobol-call, we learned how to do the cobol equivalent of calling a class.

### final
________
Our final assignment for the cobol class was building off of the editAgent assignment, but the goal was to be able to edit full records
instead of just the Agent record. We also had to implement the ability to delete records, which was a new challege for the final.
